[Trapped!](/2019/12/24/trapped/) tells the story of how I found myself in real-life escape room, and how I got out.

I love being in the wilderness, and one of my favorite ways to get out there is whitewater rafting. Two of my favorite expeditions were down the [Tatshenshini River in Alaska](/2013/08/20/tatshenshini/)
and down the [Colorado River through the Grand Canyon](/2021/11/17/grand-canyon-rafting/).
On the Tatshenshini we didn't encounter another human being for the entire trip!
