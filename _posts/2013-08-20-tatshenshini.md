and adventure calls.


The Tatshenshini river flows through Yukon and British Columbia,
where it joins the Alsek river and ultimately makes its way to
the Pacific Ocean via Alaska. It flows through Glacier Bay National Park,
BC Tatshenshini Provincial Park, Kluane National Park and Yukon Game Preserve,
which apparently form the largest non-polar ice field in the world
(<a href="http://www.tatshenshiniyukon.com/expeditiontrips.html"

I just got back from an excellent rafting trip on it,
and I’d love to share some photos and a video of the experience.

   title="The last major attraction on our way down the river was Alsek Lake. Alsek Lake is fed by a few glaciers as well as the Alsek river, and is filled with icebergs. These eventually break up into smaller chunks, which then float down the river into Dry Bay and the Pacific ocean. Dodging van-sized icebergs in the middle of rapids is a lot of fun, let me tell you."

All in all, it was a really wonderful adventure.
