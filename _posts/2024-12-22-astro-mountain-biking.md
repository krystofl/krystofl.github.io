I don't have a lot to say here other than that Astro and I both agree that mountain biking is a great way to start the day:

LADWP has been trying to close the trails at Haines Canyon due to prodding by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California State Water Resources board. Here's hoping they all take a step back and do what Astro suggests and work with the community to find a win-win way to keep the trails open.
