In November 2012, I presented a paper on the uses of consumer RGB-D devices such as the Microsoft Kinect for computer vision research at the Advances in Depth Image Analysis and Applications - WDIA 2012 conference in Tsukuba, Japan... and then took the opportunity to travel around the country for a couple of extra weeks.

It was a great experience - Japan is a beautiful, unique place. Some of my favorite photos from the trip follow.

Hiroshima is the birthplace of
[Okonomiyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki),
the "Japanese savory pancake containing a variety of ingredients". Okonomiyaki are absolutely delicious.
A great place to try Okonomiyaki is
[Okonomimura](https://goo.gl/maps/T3PD6JbVdoCuhnSe7):

Okonomimura is a whole multi-story building dedicated to Okonomiyaki! Inside are many small stalls (like the one shown above), ready to make delicious okonomiyaki right in front of you. When it's done, the chef will chop it up for you and then slide it a little closer to you. A wonderful, delicious experience.
