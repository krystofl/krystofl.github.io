_Hermit Rapid, one of the largest on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon._

Minds are sharp, adrenaline pumps, and we enter the wave train head on as our guide Tommy yells, "Go! Go hard! Go go go!" We paddle like mad dogs to get the momentum needed to punch through everything... and we do! We emerge on the far side, tired but victorious, and watch from an eddy as the other boats go in.

They follow our course... but suddenly there's a head sticking out of the water. Lora, the guide, leaps to pull the person out, only to let the boat drift sideways into the next wave. The raft flips, and now there's heads bobbing out of the water all around. "Get ready!" Tommy hollers, "We're the rescue boat now!"

Back in August, I was lucky to take part in an expedition _("big, four-syllable word" as Tommy says)_ down 226 miles of this wild brown water, from Lee's Ferry to Diamond Creek Beach, in 3 paddle rafts and 3 supporting oar rafts, spread out over about two weeks.

TODO: map of the Colorado river, and some info about it
    - The Colorado River is 1,450 miles long. Its basin was inhabited by Native Americans for at least 8,000 years, but it was a big blank spot on the map until 1869, when John Wesley Powell, a one-armed civil war veteran led 9 men in three tiny boats into it.

Today the river is dammed in many places, and excessive water use has dried up the lower 100 miles or so of the river, so that it has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s, as Chris McCandless memorably discovered in [Into the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_(book)).
But that's not where we were, and as veteran boaters might remind you, it's important not to go downriver without your boat.

Our expedition was lead by Tommy, who is precisely what you get when you take a California surfer dude and drop him on a river. The BBC called him "chilled out".

Tommy _vibes_ things - the river, the weather, people. It's an extra sense, inaccessible to mere mortals, through which Tommy taps into the language of the universe, learning of things yet to come. If Tommy can't vibe something quite yet, he _meditates_ on it, channeling the ethereal flux until a glimpse of truth manifests itself in his mind. Were Tommy to cultivate this sense for the stock market, he'd be a billionaire in a year.

Tommy would take us to _mindsnaps_ - experiences that pull you in and snap you of your train of thought and into themselves, and in some way surprise you and change your perspective.

> **Mindsnap!** Check out the BBC's Operation Grand Canyon with Dan Snow. It's a beautifully made documentary of an expedition down the Colorado, recreating Major John Wesley Powell's pioneering first expedition down the river in three rickety wooden boats. You can watch it in many places online, including [here](https://www.amazon.com/Operation-Grand-Canyon-Dan-Snow/dp/B06Y44H5JM). You'll see a lot more of the canyon there... as well as Tommy.

The scale of the canyon overwhelmed me all over again - just day after day after day of going downstream. I guess that's literally the dimension perpendicular to the grand impression you get when looking at the canyon from a good spot on the rim.

The river water is red with sediment, cool at 52 degrees Fahrenheit. The air temperature was generally warm. This has yields to an endless cycle of being hot and cold - hot in the sun, then wet and cold going through rapids, then hot again.

The river rapids were one exciting feature of the trip. Here's a still from The Kahuna Wave in Lava Falls Rapid:

The river can indeed be dangerous, even deadly. We had a few unintentional swimmers, including a boat flip in Hermit Rapid, but everyone made it out safe and sound, and overall our crew did an excellent job staying on top of things.

> **Mindsnap!** "Naked Eddie" was a dude who made a deal with some friendly people on the internet to go down the river... and no one else showed up. Eddie pressed on regardless. Tommy would run into him periodically during one of his trips, and Eddie would usually be naked in camp or trying to follow Tommy's raft through rapids. He made it out! The Grand Canyon history is full of foolhardy people doing foolhardy things. Some make it, and some don't.

Being on the river does also lead to great hiking opportunities, some of which are difficult or impossible to get to from the canyon's rim. We walked up narrow slot canyons and found many a waterfall.

Our days were long. We'd wake up with the coffee call at 5 am. On good days this would take the form of Tommy walking through camp with his guitar, singing an improvised song on the topic of morning coffee.

We'd get on the water between 7 and 8 and be on the river until 4 or 5. Dinner wrapped up around 8, we'd hang out until 9 or 10. Sleep was sometimes tricky to find, too - we had wind storms with sand everywhere, or some rain. But most of the time the weather was nice - I only pulled out a tent on three nights, and some hardy souls used it not-a-once. Somehow I think the tent made the sandstorm worse, though. On hot nights we'd soak a sarong in the river and use it as a blanket to cool off.

And then the wakeup call comes and you do it all over again. Tommy said that we were "going to need a vacation after this vacation," and he was onto something.

> Mindsnap! [Georgie White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgie_White) is a classic Grand Canyon character. She swam 60 miles down the river to demonstrate that it was doable in the case of a boating accident, and then opened a company to take paying guests down the river. By using rubber (rather than wood) boats, she was able to dramatically cut costs and make the river more accessible. She was famous for always wearing a full-length leopard-print leotard and having a Coors Lite in hand. She ran river trips up until just about her 80th birthday.

But life was easy, too. Our crew from [AZRA](https://azraft.com/) took good care of us, and fed us well. The atmosphere in camp was jolly, some of the guides and guests (including yours truly!) played songs on guitar, banjo, and violin. Food was ample and tasty, and Bekah would read us poems during dinner - about the Grand Canyon and rivers and the hardy folk who venture there. After dinner there was _rivercake_, a big spoonful of which would be plopped directly into your hands so as not to needlessly dirty any dishes.

Bekah was one of our support crew. She is half river gypsy, half Amazon, combining undeniable prowess and knowledge of whitewater with the commanding presence of a former drama-club president. She grew up on the Tallulah river, and lovingly refers to the river as "she", and asks for her blessing and safe passage each morning. During the "roaring twenties" section of the river, Bekah had a quick cry of joy - she's doing it, living the life she wanted. To her, being a river guide in the Grand Canyon is what being an astronaut is to so many young boys and girls.

TODO: Bekah photo

Earlier in life, on the Tallulah River in North Carolina, in Class V+ rapid (translation: only go there if you really know what you're doing and __Danger__ is your middle name), her boat flip, and Bekah was sucked into a hydraulic. When in one of those, you look for the light and swim towards it... but there was none, only dark green water, and Bekah didn't even know which way was up. She struggled and struggled, until finally she couldn't. Death was near, she knew. And that was OK with her - this is what she loved, this is what she wanted to do. She made peace with dying.

But somehow, she didn't die that day. She got out instead, though she still doesn't know how. And she came out stronger than ever, now with certainty that this was indeed the way she should spend her life. Even if it would ultimately kill her, this is what she loved doing and where she wanted to be.

She ran the same river, including that rapid, again the next day.

How many people do you know who have that kind of conviction in what they're doing? Would you keep doing what you're doing if there was a considerable chance that it would kill you?

It's a rare, beautiful thing.

The guide lifestyle is tough and demanding, not just on the body and mind of the guide but also on those close to them. Full-time guides spend two weeks at a time on the river, isolated from the outside world, emerge for a few days, and then go back in to the canyon. You can imagine the toll this takes on relationships. One guide told me that there was a time when she didn't see her boyfriend, also a guide, for 9 weeks straight. One day I took over as guide on her raft during a calm section of the river, and as soon as I sat down she mock-asked me questions she must have heard a hundred times: "So what's your plan for after guiding? Don't you want to have kids?" It's not a job; it's a lifestyle.

Many young guides and support crew sleep in their cars when not on the river. When one trip is over, they might drive over to Oregon or California, and guide trips there until the job winds blow back in the other direction. In the winter, the dedicated river bum transitions smoothly to a ski bum, continuing the vagabond lifestyle and shredding the gnar.
