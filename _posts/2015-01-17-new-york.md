I lived in New York City from 2013 through 2015.
These are some of my favorite photos I took during my time there.

>
The city orbits around eight million<br/>
centers of the universe<br/>
and turns around the golden clock<br/>
at the still point of this place.<br/>
Lift up your eyes from the moving hive<br/>
and you will see time circling<br/>
under a vault of stars and know<br/>
just when and where you are.<br/>

The ceiling at Grand Central Station is beautiful indeed - and easy to miss.
Next time you're there, take a break to admire it.

SantaCon is quite an event. From
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SantaCon):

>
...SantaCon had evolved from "joyful performance art" that originated in San Francisco to a "reviled bar crawl" of drunken brawling, vandalism, public urination and disorder in New York City and elsewhere, resulting in fierce community resistance and disavowals from the originators of the event.
