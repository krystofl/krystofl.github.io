For a few years now, I've been organizing a just-about-annual whitewater rafting trip for a few friends to the South Fork American River near Sacramento, CA. Here's a short video of some highlights from the 2015 and 2016 trips:

I've done this trip with a company, too, but there's a special magic that makes private trips better. Here's hoping we can keep it going for many years to come.
