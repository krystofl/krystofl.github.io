We've been getting a lot of blessed rain in Southern California this winter
(["given current conditions and model outlooks, the chance of an El Niño event to occur during March–May 2019 is estimated to be about 50–60%"](https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/climate/el-ni%C3%B1ola-ni%C3%B1a-update)),
and as a result the hills are a wonderful, verdant green right now.

Here are a few photos from the beautiful Topanga State Park,
(though let me hereby publicly shame them for not allowing dogs).
