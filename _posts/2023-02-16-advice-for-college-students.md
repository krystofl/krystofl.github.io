A few weeks ago my esteemed former colleague, [Dr. Alberto Cruz](https://complab.cs.csubak.edu/) of the California State University, Bakersfield, invited me for an interview with him and his college students about life as a software engineer and advice for Computer Science students who want to become one.

We talked about what to do in college to stand out from the crowd when applying for your first job, internships, projects, interview prep & tips, programming languages, tools of the trade, and what life is like as a software engineer.

Here's the interview:

We touched upon the [editor wars of emacs vs vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war), and if you've worked with me before my answer may surprise you.

For a bit more on the specific tools and configs that I use, check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/krystofl/dotfiles).

I had a lot of fun - thanks for the invite, Albert!
