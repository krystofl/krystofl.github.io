# Day 1: Into the Wild

All the way up to Dead Woman's Pass on the second day, the route passes through a few small villages, so we'd get glimpses of locals

A few villages up to Dead Woman's Pass, offering a snack or bathroom to the weary hiker. Animals around - horses, donkeys, dogs.

Not the original names - those are long forgotten. These names were given these places by those who rediscovered them, usually in the early 20th century. I think usually "discovery" here means someone ventured to the country and spoke to locals, who knew about the ruins and took the explorers there.

Companies by color - Alpaca is green. We all referred to the others by color - there's the orange company, the purple company, the gray company, the blue company...

Sayacmarka (lonely fort in the clouds). One of my favorites parts of the trip. We were there alone. In this way the trip actually exceeded my high expectations.

Porters not only carried these tents (and just about everything else), but they also set them up for us. They left in the morning after us, passed us, cooked us an outstanding lunch, left the lunch spot after us, passed us again, and then welcomed us to a campsite that is all setup, including our tents. This is what princes must feel like.


# Day 3: Phuyupatamarca and Winay Huaayana

Many of the porters' English was no better than mine - they are people from the local mountains, and their native tongue is Qechua.

# Day 4: Machu Picchu

Woke up at some ungodly hour - 4:30, maybe?

Climbed the feared staircase known as the "Gringo Killer" to the Sun Gate to finally, after much ado and excitement, and getting ready for this moment for twenty-something years, get our first view of Machu Picchu...

Very cool to climb the narrow stairs up to Huayna Picchu and gaze at Machu Picchu from "the other side".
