Our hotel room had a telephone in the bathroom. This may seem silly at first, until you hear about [things like this](https://krystof.litomisky.com/2019/12/24/trapped/). These things can be handy.

It's quite picturesque and memorable... so much so that it was [included in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey](https://youtu.be/3UiexQ_jDmc?t=18). In that game, unlike in real life, you're allowed to dive into the lake's pure waters.
