Without doubt, Southern California is a great place to live.

Here's a quick video that captures just a few of the fun things
I did in a single weekend - May 2-3, 2015 in LA.

In order, the things I filmed:
- mountain biking the El Prieto trail near JPL
- BBQ get-together to watch the Mayweather - Pacquiao fight
- motorcycle ride up Angeles Crest for Cafe Desmo

A solid SoCal weekend!
