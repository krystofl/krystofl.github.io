In the summer of 2023, I was invited to give a talk to the students in SuperTech FT, the STEM education non-profit, about compute hardware for robotics and autonomous vehicles. Here's a recording of that talk:

I discussed the evolution of both software
and hardware for robotics and autonomous vehicles, the different
paradigms of CPU vs GPU programming, where robots have been
successful and where they're headed, and the evolution of programming
paradigms and how AI fits in.

I hope you enjoy the talk.
