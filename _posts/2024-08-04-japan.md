Twelve years after first setting foot in Japan I made it back, and the country and its people charmed me all over again.

TODO: We also hiked on the Kumano Kodo, the ancient pilgrimage route. This was so special that I made a whole separate post about it here TODO.

I had probably the tastiest ramen I’ve ever eaten at Kyushu Jangara Akihabara. The place is tiny; the whole restaurant, including the kitchen and bathroom, would fit in an American living room. There’s cramped seating for only twelve or so customers, and the menu is short - just a few types of ramen, plus options for what toppings you want. Despite this, there’s usually a line outside. And for good reason: the ramen is just great.

If you go to Tokyo, check it out. You might also visit Ramen Nagayama, right by the Tokyo National Museum. My brother Marek says this hole in the wall spot has the best ramen he ever had. If you try both, do let me know which one is better :). I planned to do this important research myself, but ultimately didn’t make it to Ramen Nagayama due to inclement weather and an allegedly waterproof jacket that turned out to be anything but.

An experience Stephanie and I both enjoyed was visiting the teamLab Planets museum. To say that this was way, way better than the Van Gogh Immersive Experience in LA is a huge understatement. If you’re in Tokyo, check it out.

Love the narrow alleys and streets; shocked where people are able to drive their tiny kei cars

TODO: collage of tiny temples

So many temples - yes, many big famous ones, but you also come across teeny tiny ones as you wander Kyoto’s alleyways. Those tiny temples are a more intimate experience; a few times we were the only people in the whole temple area.

The intimate restaurants in Japan are nice; some fit only six customers. A pleasant aspect of this is that in these tiny places the chef prepares food right in front of you, and you get to interact with him. This is trickier when your Japanese is limited to touristy phrases, but you can make it work with a little bit of extra determination, patience, and creativity. We had nice experiences like this in a few places in Tokyo, Kyoto, and the Izu peninsula.

# Izu Peninsula

Izufornia
Take the best from three great spots
Sun, sand, wind, and stars

The Izu Peninsula is a three hour drive southwest from Tokyo. To get to its southern coast, one must make their way through the peninsula’s mountainous center, and on the other side it does feel like a different world. The locals brand it as “Izufornia”, and indeed it feels like a mix of Japanese, Californian, and Hawaiian cultures.

TODO: collage of photos from Izu

People wear Hawaiian shirts, and Hawaiian music plays in hotels and stores. But the local souvenir store also sells UCLA shirts and California-branded items. And best of all, the beach in front of our hotel in Kawazu has beautiful, soft sand. It’s the only sandy beach we saw during our trip to Japan, and here’s how excited I was to go for a swim:

I asked the owner of Donburyia if we could add our signatures to his wall; he said sorry, that’s only for movie stars. I told him Stephanie is a movie star, and he made the greatest face of pleasant shock. It was something right out of an anime. If you visit, do find our names on the wall.

We visited the Kawazu Seven Waterfalls, on the Kawazu River, which was nice.

The local area is famous for its wasabi, and small restaurants near the waterfall offer various dishes based on it. I got some soba noodles. The wasabi comes as a full root on the side, and you get a small grater to add as much as you like, the way you might do with cheese in an Italian restaurant.

Travelling in Japan is expensive, regardless of the means - trains and buses and cars are all much pricier over long distances than compared to North America or Europe, I think. Maybe because the country is so mountainous, so infrastructure is extra expensive. There are so many tunnels in so many places.

Food, on the other hand, is cheap by American standards - Stephanie and I paid $35 for all the delicious sushi and sashimi we could eat in a conveyor belt sushi place in Gose on the way to the Kumano Kodo.

7-Eleven has smoothies - you buy a cup of frozen fruit for two bucks, stick in a machine, and push a button. The machine adds some water and blends your fruit right in the cup. The result is tasty, cheap, and widely available. I can’t wait for these to come to the US.

And of course, no trip to Japan could be complete without a good look at Mt. Fuji. Here is the our view from the famous Jukkoku Pass Observation Deck.
